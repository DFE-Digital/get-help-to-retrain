    <p class="govuk-body">Your covering letter is your chance to explain to a potential employer why you’re the right person for the job.</p>
    <p class="govuk-body">To create a good first impression, make sure your covering letter:</p>
    <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
      <li>is well written</li>
      <li>doesn't contain any spelling mistakes or bad grammar</li>
      <li>supports what's in your CV</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="govuk-body">A good covering letter will show that you've done your research, you know what the job involves and what the employer's looking for.</p>

              Covering letters - the main rules
            </span>
          </h2>
        </div>
        <div id="accordion-cover-letter-advice-content-1" class="govuk-accordion__section-content" aria-labelledby="accordion-cover-letter-advice-heading-1">
          <p class="govuk-body">Your covering letter should be short and to the point. Write it on a computer as it makes it easier to make any changes or corrections before you send it.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">If you’re applying for a different type of work than you’ve done before, your covering letter is your chance to show how your work history has given you the skills and experience the hiring manager needs. For example, if your past roles have developed your skills in areas such as time management or customer service, explain how these skills will be useful in the role you’re targeting. This shows that you understand what’s required of you in the target role and also shows how you’d be good at it.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Highlight your most relevant skills and achievements, and explain any gaps in your CV, like periods of unemployment, time spent in prison, travelling or being a carer. For each of these explain what you learned from the experience.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">Make specific reference to the employer - don't send out identical covering letters with no organisation details. Use the right language and tone, and the same font and text size as on your CV. Always check for spelling and grammatical errors.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">If you have a disability you don't need to mention this if you don't want to. If you mention a disability at the application stage, it can give you an opportunity to talk about the transferable skills you've developed as a result of dealing with your disability.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">It's important to address your letter to the person named in the advert, if there is one. If there isn't, find out the name of the recruiter or the head of the department you want to work for.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">You also need to:</p>
          <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>spell any names correctly and address them with their preferred title, whether it's Dr, Mr, Mrs, or Ms</li>
            <li>explain why you're writing</li>
            <li>be clear about what you're applying for by including the full title of the job, the reference number, and where you saw it advertised</li>
            <li>research the company and the job to find out the main skills the employer is looking for</li>
            <li>give evidence to show that you have the right personal qualities, experience, qualifications, and skills for the role</li>
            <li>include real examples of when you've used these skills, and highlight any major achievements, like completing training courses</li>
            <li>present your skills in a way that shows how giving you the job will benefit the organization you want to work for</li>

Show you're familiar with their products and services, and recent news about them.
