          <p class="govuk-body">If the job involves working with people, try to show your people skills by uses phrases like: 'negotiating', 'effectively dealing with demanding customers', 'handling conflict' or 'showing empathy'. These help the reader build up a picture of your skills, knowledge and experience. Keep it short - you can go into more detail later.</p>
          <p class="govuk-body">When describing your career aims, think about the employer you're sending the CV to. Make your careers aims sound just like the kind of opportunities they currently have.</p>
